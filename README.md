# Chest-X_Ray_Prediction-Model

Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images?resource=download

Aim: To detect if the X Ray shows no disease (NORMAL) result or detects pneumonia with its cause BACTERIA or VIRUS

Technology Used: Deep Learning used with CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model implemented with densely connected neural layers, filter layers and max pooling. Dropout Regularization was done to prevent overfitting of model.
